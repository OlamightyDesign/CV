          <h3>LOGO DESIGNS </h3>
          <p>Logos are images, texts, shapes, or a combination of the three that depict the name and purpose of a business â€“ to put it simply. However, a logo can and should be more than a symbol of identification. If designed well, it also tells a company's story, by conveying your brand message.</p>
